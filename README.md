This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A simple viewer of a week, in which Calender-Events can be created and changed.

Built with React and moment.js and the usage of the CSS-Grid functionality.

Usage:

1.  Clone the repository

2.  run `yarn install` or `npm install` in the same directory

3.  run `yarn start` or `npm start`

Now a browser-window should open with `localhost:3000` and in there the runs application. 

Clicking some empty space on a day should open a small box, which has the date which was clicked on preselected. 
Once an event was added, it appears as blue box on that same day. If you hover over that event, a small button "Edit" should appear. If clicked, the already known little box appears again, but this time with the additional button "Delete", which does exactly that.
